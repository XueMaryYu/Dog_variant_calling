# To find out the SNVs that are only presented in the deseased dogs. we combine all the diseased dogs RNA-seq data as one group
# and all the health dogs RNA-seq data as another group.
# first separate experiment group and control group into two folders
# next combine the reads together
# In the experiment group folder
cat *R1.fastq.gz > experiment_R1.fastq.gz
cat *R2.fastq.gz > experiment_R2.fastq.gz
# In the control group folder
cat *R1.fastq.gz > control_R1.fastq.gz
cat *R2.fastq.gz > control_R2.fastq.gz
